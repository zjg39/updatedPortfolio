# updatedPortfolio

## Concept

### This is an update of a previous portfolio.  Included are some of my more recent projects, all of which were constructed while attending the Georgia Tech Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp.  The links to the various projects lead to their respective GitHub pages, and contact links can be found at the bottom.

## Futher plans...

### I certainly plan to return to this portfolio once the bootcamp is finished and I have more time detail it in the ways that I want.  I would love to experiment with reactive pictures and boxes, and some of the other new CSS concepts that I have learned.
